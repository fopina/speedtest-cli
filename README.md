This is a simple command line client to speedtest.net written in Go.

It is a direct port from https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli written in Python. It lacks some of the features though, e.g. `-mini` and `-share` options are not supported.

Installation
------------

Dowload a pre-built binary from [releases](https://github.com/fopina/speedtest-cli/releases) such as:

```
curl -L https://github.com/fopina/speedtest-cli/releases/download/v1.0.0/speedtest-cli_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli
```

Or build from latest source

```
go get github.com/fopina/speedtest-cli
go install github.com/fopina/speedtest-cli
```

Usage
-----

Without any arguments `speedtest-cli` tests the speed against the closest server with the lowest latency.

The following command line options are available:
```
  -bytes
        Display values in bytes instead of bits. Does not affect the image generated by -share
  -h    Shorthand for -help option
  -help
        Show usage information and exit
  -insecure
    	Allow connections to Speedtest.net sites over HTTPS without validating certs. Useful in devices without CA bundles installed.
  -interface string
        IP address of network interface to bind to
  -list
        Display a list of speedtest.net servers sorted by distance
  -quiet
        Suppress verbose output, only show basic information
  -server uint
        Specify a server ID to test against
  -timeout duration
        HTTP timeout duration. Default 10s (default 10s)
  -version
        Show the version number and exit
```
